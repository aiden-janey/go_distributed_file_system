# Distributed File Storage In Go â€“ Full Course

This is a tutorial I followed from freeCodeCamp.org to use a new programming language, Go, and learn a little more about low-level programming, network protocols (TCp/UDP) & system design.

### Notes:

- The main func in main.go needs to shared the name of the package (main), to be compiled w/ the Makefile.
- **Why use pointers in tcp_transport.go? Is this the most efficient way to send structs via TCP socket? Or is it that the data types aren't fully fleshed out yet?**
- Public functions @ the top, private @ bottom & orgnaize based on importance & readability
